      </header>
      <p> Pokémon came from the concept of bug catching. This makes up one half the the goal in almost every iteration of Pokémon.  Part 1 is to collect as many Pokémon as possible. Players can do that by catching Pokémon in the wild, via trading and through evolution of a particular species. Part 2 is to train the caught Pokémon though Pokémon battles. The higher the level of your Pokémon, the better your chances at beating other Pokémon trainers, Gym leaders and eventually the Pokémon League.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collecting Pokémon
Collecting Pokémon can be a game within itself. There are 5 ways trainers can capture Pokémon and complete their Pokedex.</li>
        <li>Competitive Pokémon battling is serious business. The most dedicated of trainers even consider stats known as Effort Values(EVs) and Individual Values(IVs). </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Capturing wild Pokémon- Either by way of fishing, walking around in tall grass or being in the middle of a swarm; there are always wild Pokémon up for grabs. Trainers weaken the wild Pokémon by lowering its health in battle without beating it to make it easier to capture.</p>

      <p>Rather than just being a superficial personality, Natures actually affect the growth of a Pokémon. Each nature increases one of its stats by 10% and decreases one by 10% (by the time it reaches level 100)</p>

        Individual Values (IVs)</h1>
      </header>
      <p>are the Pokémon equivalent of genes. They are instrumental in determining the stats of a Pokémon, being responsible for the large variation in stats among untrained Pokémon of the same species.

Each of the six battle stats has an IV associated with it, with that IV coming into calculation alongside the Pokémon's base stats, Nature, and EVs to determine the actual stat number. A Pokémon's IVs are fixed when it is generated by the game (i.e. when it is obtained as an Egg from the Pokémon Day Care, encountered in the wild, or given to the player by an NPC), and cannot be changed (although Hyper Training causes stats to become values corresponding the maximum IVs).</p>

      <p>It is a temporary evolution that can be initiated in battle if the Pokémon is holding the Mega Stone for their species, however only select pokémon can undergo Mega Evolution. It can be triggered in battle before attacking, and it allows the pokémon to attack after undergoing Mega Evolution.

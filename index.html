      <p> Pokémon came from the concept of bug catching. This makes up one half the the goal in almost every iteration of Pokémon.  Part 1 is to collect as many Pokémon as possible. Players can do that by catching Pokémon in the wild, via trading and through evolution of a particular species. Part 2 is to train the caught Pokémon though Pokémon battles. The higher the level of your Pokémon, the better your chances at beating other Pokémon trainers, Gym leaders and eventually the Pokémon League.</p>

        <li>Competitive Pokémon battling is serious business. The most dedicated of trainers even consider stats known as Effort Values(EVs) and Individual Values(IVs). </li>

      <p>Capturing wild Pokémon- Either by way of fishing, walking around in tall grass or being in the middle of a swarm; there are always wild Pokémon up for grabs. Trainers weaken the wild Pokémon by lowering its health in battle without beating it to make it easier to capture.</p>

      <h1> Breeding Pokemon</h1>
      </header>
      
      <p>Pokémon breeding is a method of obtaining a new Pokémon by producing and hatching an Egg. There are several reasons to breed Pokemon.
      <div class="Border1">
      <code>
        Egg Moves:
These are moves that are passed down from a parent to an offspring Pokemon.
However, there are only some specific moves that are passed down from the parents.
        <br>
        <br>
        IVs (Individual Values):
These are genetic factors in Pokemon, to be short. These factors determine how much will the Pokemon have in it's stats. They are explained more below.
        <br>
        <br>
        Natures:
Natures stand for personalities of Pokemon. They simultaneously increase a stat and decrease another one. A list of natures and what they do are explained below.

      <h1> Pokemon Natures
      </h1>
      </header>
      
      <p>Rather than just being a superficial personality, Natures actually affect the growth of a Pokémon. Each nature increases one of its stats by 10% and decreases one by 10% (by the time it reaches level 100) 
      <br>
      <br>
      The different natures for pokemon are listed below:

      <ul>
        <code>
        <li>Adamant	increases Attack and decreases	Sp. Atk</li>
        <li> Bashful is a neutral nature</li>
        <li> Bold	 Increases Defense	and decreases Attack</li>
        <li> Brave increases Attack and decreases Speed</li>
        <li> Calm	increases Sp. Def and increases Attack</li>
        <li> Careful increases Sp. Def and decreases Sp. Atk </li>
        <li> Docile	is neutral</li>
        <li> Gentle	increases Sp. Def	and decreases Defense</li>
        <li>  Hardy is neutral</li>

        <li> Jolly increases Speed and decreases Sp. Atk </li>
        <li> Lax increases Defense and decreases Sp. Def </li>
        <li> Lonely increases Attack	and decreases Defense</li>
        <li> Mild	increases Sp. Atk and decreases	Defense </li>

        <li>Quirky is neutral </li>
        <li>Rash increases Sp. Atk and decreases Sp. Def </li>
        <li>Relaxed	increases Defense	and decreases Speed</li>
        <li>Sassy	increases Sp. Def and decreases	Speed</li>
        <li>Serious is neutral</li>
        <li>Timid	increases Speed and decreases	Attack</li>

    <section class="main-section" id="Effort_Values">
      <header>
      <h1> Effort Values</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
EV stands for “Effort Value.” They determine what stats your Pokémon gets upon levelling up and are gained from battling any Pokémon you come across that award Experience points.
      <br>
      <br>
        Each Pokémon you battle against gives off EVs in one or more stats. Generally, this relates to the Pokémon's strongest stat - for example, if you battle a Geodude your Pokémon will get one EV in the Defense stat. If you fight a Gengar, you will get three Special Attack EVs. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Newly-hatched eggs and Pokémon caught in the wild - regardless of level - have no EVs and thus act as a blank sheet for EV training. Any Pokémon that has gained experience points from battling will have gained some EVs.
Every 4 EVs obtained in a particular stat equals one more point for that stat, by the time that Pokémon reaches level 100.
        <br>
        <br>
        In total a Pokémon can gain 510 EVs, but only 255 in one stat. Since 4 EVs equals one stat point, if you want to max out a particular stat it's only useful to get 252 EVs.

        Individual Values </h1>
      </header>
      <p>Individual values are the Pokémon equivalent of genes. They are instrumental in determining the stats of a Pokémon, being responsible for the large variation in stats among untrained Pokémon of the same species.

Each of the six battle stats has an IV associated with it, with that IV coming into calculation alongside the Pokémon's base stats, Nature, and EVs to determine the actual stat number. A Pokémon's IVs are fixed when it is generated by the game (i.e. when it is obtained as an Egg from the Pokémon Day Care, encountered in the wild, or given to the player by an NPC), and cannot be changed (although Hyper Training causes stats to become values corresponding the maximum IVs).</p>

      </header>
      <p>Egg Moves are a special move that a Pokémon is able to inherit through breeding from only one parent. Egg Moves often (but not always) cannot be learned through other ways.
      <br> 
        The way the Pokémon inherits moves are based solely upon the base form's own learnset. The parents that need to know the moves are as follows; </p>
      <br>

        <div class="Border1">
      <code>
        Moves in baby's Level Up: Both Parents

Technical Machine (TM) Moves: Father
        <br>
Egg Moves: Father
        <br>
Move Tutor Moves: Cannot be bred
        <br>
As of Pokémon X & Y, it is now also possible for the mother to pass Egg Moves down. If the mother has one of the Egg Moves of the baby, it will pass the move down.

         </h1>
         
       </header>
       <p> Pokemon evolution is a process in which a Pokémon changes into a different species of Pokémon.
       <br>
         Pokémon can be divided into different evolutionary stages, based on where they appear in their evolution family. All Pokémon fall into one of four groups: baby Pokémon, unevolved Pokémon, first-evolution Pokémon, and second-evolution Pokémon.
         <br>
       </p>
       <div class="Border1">
       <code>
         <b>One-evolution families:</b> The most common type of evolution family, these families are based in a Pokémon that will only ever evolve once in its development. About one third of all Pokémon that would later get a baby form were part of this kind of evolution family before their baby form was revealed.
         <br>
         <b>Two-evolution families:</b> Feature two separate evolutionary events in the Pokémon's development.
         <br>
         <b>Pokémon that do not evolve:</b> The least common type of evolution family is that in which no evolutionary event takes place, meaning that it is made up of only one member. Many of the Pokémon that have no evolutionary relatives are Legendary and Mythical Pokémon. However, there are still 75 other Pokémon that do not evolve.

      <h1> Mega Evolution
      </h1>
      </header>
      <p>Mega Evolution is a temporary evolution that can be initiated in battle if the Pokémon is holding the Mega Stone for their species, however only select pokémon can undergo Mega Evolution. It can be triggered in battle before attacking, and it allows the pokémon to attack after undergoing Mega Evolution. Only one pokémon per team can be in its mega evolution, and after the battle is over any pokémon in their mega evolution return to their normal form.</p>

   <section class="main-section" id="Z_Moves">
     <header>
     <h1>Z Moves 
     </h1>
     </header>
     <p> A Z Move is a special type of move introduced in Generation VII in which a Trainer and their Pokémon's wishes combine to unleash an attack comprising the full power of both. These moves are very powerful, but they can only be used once per battle. 
     <br>
     <br>
       Z-Moves may only be used once per battle, and they require various different items to be equipped to be used successfully. In this way, they are not unlike Mega Evolutions: it might be easier to envision them as Mega Evolutions except in the form of a move.
       <br>
       <br>
In order for a Pokemon to use a Z-Move, its trainer must be in possession of an item called a Z-Ring. For a Z-Move to happen, this Z-Ring must be equipped with a Z-Crystal that corresponds with the type of move that should be used. For example, the Z-Crystal called "Waterium Z" will trigger the Water-type Z-Move called "Hydro Vortex".
       <br>
       
       An example of a few Z moves are: </p>
     <br>
     
       <div class="Border1">
     <code>
       Breakneck Blitz: A Normal-type Z-Move.
       <br>
      
All-Out Pummeling: A Fighting-type Z-Move. 
       <br>
Never-Ending Nightmare: A Ghost-type Z-Move. 
       <br>
       
Inferno Overdrive: A Fire-type Z-Move. 
       <br>
Hydro Vortex: A Water-type Z-Move. 
       <br>
Bloom Doom: A Grass-type Z-Move. 
       <br>
Gigavolt Havoc: An Electric-type Z-Move.
